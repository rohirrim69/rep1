The good life is what I need
Too many people stepping over me
The only thing that's been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
Oh
The good life
All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
The good life
(The good life)
